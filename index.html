    <h1>Hello world!</h1>
    <p>Welcome to my first website.</p>
    <h2>Web Security</h2>
    <p id="web-security-question">How would you advise a potential client to secure his/her website from web security attacks? Note: the word count for your answer should not be greater than 250 words</p>
    <p id="web-security-answer">
        <p>In order to consult a potential client on how to protect his/her website from attacks, I should firstly state the importance of website security. It can be simplified into a website without security like a house without locked doors that any malicious attackers can easily get into. This consequently causes the loss of private and confidential information such as email addresses, passwords and credit card details. The website can be out of control and even the business may be in danger.
        </p>
        <p>I should also give a quick sum of some common threats such as Cross-site Scripting (XSS), SQL injection, Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF), etc. for the clients to get an overall view before coming up with possible protections to keep the website safe and sound. They can be:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Sanitizing all data before being passed to next steps. Never trust any input data which is user-originated. Be careful with files uploaded.</li>
          <li>Encouraging to enable HTTPS and HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) protocols. This will ensure data sent between the client and server to be protected from attackers.
        </li>
          <li>Taking the advantages of available vulnerability scanner tools to test the security of the website. A bug bounty program can be a good way to fix bugs.</li>
          <li>Strengthening passwords and using two-factor authentication to log in.</li>
          <li>Using a server-side web framework. Being up-to-date with the most popular threats.</li>
          <li>Eliminating storing sensitive information like credit card details.</li>
          <li>Always being ready for the worst with regular backups.</li>
        </ul>
